  <li>An explanation of the project.</li>
  <li>Links to each visualizations page, with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot and link that takes user to that visualization.</li>
</ul>

  <li>A descriptive title and heading tag.</li>
  <li>The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.</li>
  <li>A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.</li>
</ul>

<strong>A "Comparisons" page that:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Contains all of the visualizations on the same page for easy comparison.</li>

<strong>At the top of each page, the website contains a navigation menu that:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.</li>
