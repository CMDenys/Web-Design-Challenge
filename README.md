# Web-Design-Challenge

For this project, a visualization dashboard website was created using visualizations created in a previous assignment concerning weather data.  

Included in the website are:

A landing page containing: 
<ul>
  <li>An explanation of the project.</li>
  <li>Links to each visualizations page, with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot and link that takes user to that visualization.</li>
</ul>

•	Four visualization pages, each with: 
o	A descriptive title and heading tag.
o	The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
o	A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
•	A "Comparisons" page that: 
o	Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
o	Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 
	The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
•	A "Data" page that: 
o	Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations. 
	The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint 
	The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a nifty method approprately called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe. See the documentation here
